# Singleton-Implementation-Unity
A sample project explaining the usage of singleton object to hold global game state.


### Usage : 
Import the package [Unity-Singleton/Package/Unity Singleton.unitypackage](https://github.com/BharathVishal/Singleton-Implementation-Unity/blob/master/Package/Unity%20Singleton.unitypackage) from Unity (or) open the project under 
[Unity-Singleton/Source Project/](https://github.com/BharathVishal/Singleton-Implementation-Unity/tree/master/Source%20Project/Unity%20Singleton).

1. The Singleton_Controller class holds the global game state consistently during scene switches.
   - This is explained through the score variable.
