# Unity Singleton
A sample project explaining the usage of singleton object to hold global game state.


### Usage : 
Import the package [Particle-System-Unity/Package/Particle_System.unitypackage](https://github.com/BharathVishal/Particle-System-Unity/blob/master/Package/Particle_System.unitypackage) from Unity (or) open the project under 
[Unity-Singleton/Source Project/](https://github.com/BharathVishal/Unity-Singleton/tree/master/Source%20Project/Unity%20Singleton).

1. The Singleton_Controller class holds the global game state consistently during scene switches.
   - This is explained through the score variable. 
2. Modify the code to suit your needs.
