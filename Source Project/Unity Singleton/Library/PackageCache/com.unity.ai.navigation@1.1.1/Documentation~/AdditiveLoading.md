# Loading Multiple NavMeshes using Additive Loading

The NavMeshes in different [**Scenes**][1] are not connect by default. When you load another level using _Application.LoadLevelAdditive()_ you will need to connect the NavMeshes in different Scenes using an Off-Mesh link.

In this example we have _Scene 1_ and _Scene 2_. The _Scene 1_ has an Off-Mesh Link starting over a walkable area and landing over a walkable area in _Scene 2_. There can be as many Off-Mesh Links connecting the Scenes as necessary.

When authored the other end point of the scene connecting Off-Mesh links are not connected. After a new Scene is loaded, the Off-Mesh Links will be reconnected.

If the multiple scenes have [**NavMesh**][2] overlapping at the same area, the position picking may be arbitrary NavMesh at that location. This applies to agents, Off-Mesh Links and position picking using the NavMesh API. You should create the scene crossing Off-Mesh links so that they start and end clearly on over one NavMesh only. Overlapping NavMesh areas are not automatically connected.
