# Navigation and Pathfinding

![](./Images/NavMeshCover.png)

The navigation system allows you to create characters that can intelligently move around the game world, using navigation meshes that are created automatically from your [**Scene**][1] geometry. Dynamic obstacles allow you to alter the navigation of the characters at runtime, while off-mesh links let you build specific actions like opening doors or jumping down from a ledge. This section describes Unity's navigation and pathfinding systems in detail.

You can learn more on how to visualize your scene's navigation information in the [Navigation Debug Visualization](NavigationDebugVisualization.md) section of this documentation.
