2. Contact your Unity representative to get access to Mediation in the dashboard.
3. Select **Unity Mediation** as the Ads Provider for each project you want to set up to use Mediation.
4. Set up your ad sources by configuring third-party ad networks in the Unity Dashboard.

In your Unity project, go to **Project Settings** > **Services** > **Mediation** to open the Mediation Configuration page and install the ad network adapters for each ad source you configured in the Unity Dashboard.
